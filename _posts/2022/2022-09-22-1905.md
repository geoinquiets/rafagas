- desc: Climate change is rising Arctic temperatures faster than the world average,
    and wildfires are moving to the North pole burning boreal forests and tundra,
    liberating large amounts of greenhouse gases
  keyw: forests

    desc: Wildfires are shifting poleward where the flames release vast amounts of
      greenhouse gases from the carbon-rich soil

- desc: Green areas benefit health and well-being, so tree distribution in cities
    should improve to reduce heat islands, especially in the poorest communities
  keyw: trees

  microlink:
    desc: A significant disparity in tree cover across urban neighborhoods leads to
      differences in temperatures and health outcomes.
