    desc: Our goal is to include scripts from indigenous and minority cultures who
      are in danger of losing their sense of history, identity and purpose and who
      are trying to protect, preserve and/or revive their writing system as a way
      of reconnecting to their past, their dignity, their sense of a way ahead.
