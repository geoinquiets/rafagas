    desc: A Python ecosystem offers numerous tools for the visualisation of data on
      a map. A lot of them depend on XYZ tiles, providing a base map layer, either
      from OpenStreetMap, satellite or other sources. The issue is that each package
      that offers XYZ support manages its own list of supported providers.
