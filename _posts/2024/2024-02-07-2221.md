    desc: 'As a reader of the Cryosphere blog, you may have spent a lot of time looking
      at the Greenland Ice Sheet, but do you really know what Greenland looks like?
      This “It Ain’t Easy Being Greenland” map is something I made for fun during
      the #30DayMapChallenge (an international project to complete one map a day during
      the month of November) and highlights how different the island country appears
      depending on the map projection it is depicted with. Because Greenland is located
      near the north pole, it can be significantly more distorted by some map projections
      compared to places near the equator. It’s Kinda Easy Being Greenland You are
      likely most familiar with Greenland in the pervasive Mercator projection (see
      figure 1) – elongated and large, with the northern portion expanded more than
      the narrow south, kind of like a piece of pizza. The Mercator projection is
      one of the most pervasive map projections mainly for two good reasons: 1. preserving
      distance was so important to early navigation (and Mercator preserves angles
      meaning there’s accurate compass bearings), and 2. it is also the projection
      Google Maps uses. But, depending on the map projection used, Greenland might
      be absolutely unrecognizable to you! For example, in the Cube and the Fuller
      projections, Greenland looks more recognizable as a dog’s head (check out the
      featured image at the beginning of this post). If you’re using the Goode Homolsine
      projection, Greenland even gets split into two butterfly wing-like parts. So
      what does Greenland really look like? Well, this seemingly simple question may
      be harder to answer than it appears. Figure 1: The shape of Greenland in the
      Mercator map projection. [Credit: Kate Berg] It Ain’t Easy Going From 3D to
      2D In reality, the world is approximately a sphere. So how do you perfectly
      translate a 3D object like that onto a 2D surface as a map? The answer is: you
      don’t. There’s no perfect way to get the sphere to lay flat and there will always
      be some kind of distortion when you try to “project” the sphere onto a rectangular
      surface (hence the term map projection). See Gauss’s Theorema Egregium for a
      deep dive into the related math proof. Now what you choose to preserve and what
      to distort is up to the cartographer. One such distortion tradeoff is choosing
      to preserve shape and angles as is done in the Mercator projection, but that
      comes at the cost of distorting the size of continents, especially at the poles.
      This is why the arctic Greenland appears to be so massive; it appears to be
      about the same size as Africa (that’s a really large ice sheet if that was true!)
      (figure 2). In reality, Greenland is approximately 800,000 square miles (2 million
      square kilometers) in area, so about 15 times smaller than Africa, which is
      12 million square miles (30 million square kilometers). A fun (and educational)
      way to compare the true size of countries is to check out www.thetruesize.com.
      Figure 2: Greenland’s size compared to the size of Africa in the Mercator map
      projection. [Credit: Kate Berg] If you wanted to preserve land size, you could
      use an equal-area map such as the Mollweide projection (figure 3). This projection
      better translates the actual area, but the shape and angles are quite distorted.
      This means that two countries that have the same area on the 3D Earth will have
      the same area on the 2D map and, as such, this projection is great for comparing
      relative sizes of surfaces globally. Another equal-area projection, the Gall-Peters,
      is infamous in the cartography realm because it was featured in a classic West
      Wing TV show scene. That linked video has 2.1 million views and I wouldn’t be
      surprised if the majority of views are from GIS (geographic information system)
      professors showing the clip in class. Figure 3: Greenland’s size compared to
      the size of Africa in the Mollweide map projection. [Credit: Kate Berg] So what
      if you wanted to minimize as much distortion as possible in a sort of compromise
      projection? The National Geographic Society has adopted the Winkel-Tripel projection,
      so called because it does its best to reduce distance, area, and direction distortions
      – a triple threat! It Ain’t Easy Picking the Perfect Projection At the end of
      the day, there isn’t a perfect projection. “Right” and “wrong” projections depend
      on the purpose and audience of the map and what tradeoffs the cartographer wants
      to make. You can find a more thorough list of map projections (and the option
      to compare them) at Map-Projections.net. Once you’ve explored all the projections,
      head over to one of my favorite comics by XKCD, “What your favorite map projection
      says about you” to see what it means. Perhaps you’ll find that it also ain’t
      easy picking a favorite projection! Further reading For more about this map
