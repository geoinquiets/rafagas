    desc: While we know that we use more water for irrigation than for any other single
      purpose, watering practices are not monitored worldwide. Water needed for agriculture
      is expected to further increase as time goes on, so managing this precious resource
      as effectively as possible is imperative. Scientists have now shown that a nifty
      way of using information from satellites could pave the way to measuring how
      much water we use to irrigate, which could subsequently lead to better management.
