    desc: 'BACKGROUND: Extreme temperatures contribute significantly to global mortality.
      While previous

      studies on temperature and stroke-specific outcomes presented conflicting results,

      these studies were predominantly limited to single-city or single-country analyses.

      Their findings are difficult to synthesize due to variations in methodologies
      and

      exposure definitions. METHODS: Within the Multi-Country Multi-City Network,
      we built a new mortality database for

      ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. Applying a unified analysis protocol, we conducted

      a multinational case-crossover study on the relationship between extreme temperatures

      and stroke. In the first stage, we fitted a conditional quasi-Poisson regression
      for

      daily mortality counts with distributed lag nonlinear models for temperature
      exposure

      separately for each city. In the second stage, the cumulative risk from each
      city

      was pooled using mixed-effect meta-analyses, accounting for clustering of cities
      with

      similar features. We compared temperature-stroke associations across country-level

      gross domestic product per capita. We computed excess deaths in each city that
      are

      attributable to the 2.5% hottest and coldest of days based on each city’s temperature

      distribution. RESULTS: We collected data for a total of 3 443 969 ischemic strokes
      and 2 454 267 hemorrhagic

      stroke deaths from 522 cities in 25 countries. For every 1000 ischemic stroke
      deaths,

      we found that extreme cold and hot days contributed 9.1 (95% empirical CI, 8.6–9.4)

      and 2.2 (95% empirical CI, 1.9–2.4) excess deaths, respectively. For every 1000
      hemorrhagic

      stroke deaths, extreme cold and hot days contributed 11.2 (95% empirical CI,
      10.9–11.4)

      and 0.7 (95% empirical CI, 0.5–0.8) excess deaths, respectively. We found that
      countries

      with low gross domestic product per capita were at higher risk of heat-related
      hemorrhagic

      stroke mortality than countries with high gross domestic product per capita
      (P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Both extreme cold and hot temperatures are associated
      with an increased risk of dying

      from ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes. As climate change continues to exacerbate
      these

      extreme temperatures, interventional strategies are needed to mitigate impacts
      on

      stroke mortality, particularly in low-income countries. Graphical Abstract'
