    desc: Water vapour is a critical atmospheric parameter to understand the Earth’s
      climate system and it is characterized by a complex variability in time and
      space. GNSS observations have become an important source of information of the
      water vapour, thanks to its high temporal and spatial resolution. However, the
      lack of meteorological sites collocated with the GNSS site could hamper water
      vapour retrieval. The empirical blind models can fill this gap. This study analyses
      the temporal and spatial distribution of the water vapour using nine GNSS sites
      located on the Atlantic coast of Spain and France, with the empirical blind
      model GPT3 as the source of meteorological information. The observations were
      processed with Bernese 5.2 software on a double difference approach and validated
      with Zenith Total Delay EUREF REPRO2 values. Consequently, four-years series
      of water vapour was determined and validated using two matched radiosonde sites.
      The characterization of the water vapour on the area shows clear seasonal characteristics
      that the technique captures, using an empirical blind model for the whole process.
      Maximum values are observed in summer season and minimum in winter. The PWV
      tends to decrease with increasing latitude in the area of the study. The short-term
      variations can be reproduced by the high temporal resolution of the GNSS-retrieved
      water vapour and show a different behaviour over the area, but a similar pattern
      with a peak in the afternoon and minimum at night was found. Also, less variability
      is observed in winter season and higher in summertime.
