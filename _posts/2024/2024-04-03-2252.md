    desc: The international “Night of Geography”, promoted by EUGEO and IGU, will
      be held on April 5th and 12th 2024. The GeoNight is an initiative proposed for
      the first time by the CNFG (French National Geographical Committee) at a National
      scale in 2017. From 2018 onwards, the initiative has expanded internationally,
      first in Europe, thanks to EUGEO, and then even beyond, thanks to the IGU. This
      website has been created and is managed by Massimiliano Tabusi and Arturo Gallia.
