    desc: Provided here are various forms of the Stanford Thermal Earth Model, as
      well as the data and methods used for its creation. The predictions produced
      by this model were visualized in two-dimensional spatial maps across the modeled
      depths (0-7 km) for the conterminous United States. The thermal earth model
      is made available as an application programming interface (API) and as feature
      layers on ArcGIS, which are both provided via links below. A data-driven spatial
      interpolation algorithm based on physics-informed graph neural networks was
      used to develop these national temperature-at-depth maps. The model satisfied
      the three-dimensional heat conduction law by predicting subsurface temperature,
      surface heat flow, and rock thermal conductivity. Many physical quantities,
      including bottomhole temperature, depth, geographic coordinates, elevation,
      sediment thickness, magnetic anomaly, gravity anomaly, gamma-ray flux of radioactive
      elements, seismicity, and electric conductivity were used as model inputs. Surface
      heat flow, temperature, and thermal conductivity predictions were constructed
      for depths of 0-7 km at an interval of 1 km with spatial resolution of 18 km2
      per grid cell. The model showed superior temperature, surface heat flow and
      thermal conductivity mean absolute errors of 4.8C, 5.817 mW/m2 and 0.022 W/(C-m),
      respectively.
