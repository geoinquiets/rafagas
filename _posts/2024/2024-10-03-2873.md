    desc: Our proposed pipeline for mesh-based visual place recognition. The training
      phase consists in downloading training (real) images and the 3D mesh, generating
      their synthetic counterparts and specializing the synthetic model through feature
      alignment. Once the training phase is completed, the deployment phase can take
      part on any target city.

      phone and relied instead on serendipity — and maps made by people he met along
      the way.
