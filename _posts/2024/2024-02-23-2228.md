      soils and vegetation throughout the valley even at remote high-alpine ecosystems
      and conservation areas, according to a terrestrial landscape-scale field campaign
      in the European Alps.

    desc: This map was designed to be printed on six feet of thermal receipt paper.
      Why on earth would anyone do that, you ask? After making a ribbon map of the
      Suwannee River, multiple people (jokingly?) suggested that I look into receipt
      printers when I explained how I needed to print the Suwannee map out in four
      sections. And the more I thought about it, the more that the idea of working
      within such absurd limitations sounded fun. So I created this map, and I’ll
      touch on all the things you might want to consider if you, too, want to print
      a map on thermal receipt printer. If you’re on mobile and want to skip to the
      full map, tap here.
