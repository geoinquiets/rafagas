    desc: The application of machine learning (ML) in a range of geospatial tasks
      is increasingly common but often relies on globally available covariates such
      as satellite imagery that can either be expensive or lack predictive power.
      Here we explore the question of whether the vast amounts of knowledge found
      in Internet language corpora, now compressed within large language models (LLMs),
      can be leveraged for geospatial prediction tasks. We first demonstrate that
      LLMs embed remarkable spatial information about locations, but naively querying
      LLMs using geographic coordinates alone is ineffective in predicting key indicators
      like population density. We then present GeoLLM, a novel method that can effectively
      extract geospatial knowledge from LLMs with auxiliary map data from OpenStreetMap.
      We demonstrate the utility of our approach across multiple tasks of central
      interest to the international community, including the measurement of population
      density and economic livelihoods. Across these tasks, our method demonstrates
      a 70% improvement in performance (measured using Pearson’s $r^2$) relative to
      baselines that use nearest neighbors or use information directly from the prompt,
      and performance equal to or exceeding satellite-based benchmarks in the literature.
      With GeoLLM, we observe that GPT-3.5 outperforms Llama 2 and RoBERTa by 19%
      and 51% respectively, suggesting that the performance of our method scales well
      with the size of the model and its pretraining dataset. Our experiments reveal
      that LLMs are remarkably sample-efficient, rich in geospatial information, and
      robust across the globe. Crucially, GeoLLM shows promise in mitigating the limitations
      of existing geospatial covariates and complementing them well.
