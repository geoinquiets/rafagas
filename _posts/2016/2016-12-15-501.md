    desc: The tag line for the Pelagios Commons web site is, “Linking the Places of
      our Past,” and that project is indeed facilitating the linking of historical
      place attestations published in digital gazetteers. From my perspective (and
      many others’) , the initiative is going great, bravo!

    desc: OSM Landuse Landcover is a WebGIS application to explore the OpenStreetMap
      database specifically in terms of landuse and landcover information. Absence
      of land use tags resulted in data gaps. Using belows (Schultz et al. 2017) approach
      this was addressed for Germany.
