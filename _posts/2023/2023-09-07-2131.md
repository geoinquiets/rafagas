    desc: A while back, one of our ninjas added a new algorithm in QGIS’ processing
      toolbox named ST-DBSCAN Clustering, short for spatio temporal density-based
      spatial clustering of applications with noise. The algorithm regroups features
      falling within a user-defined maximum distance and time duration values…
